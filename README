Alien::Base will be a base class to help build Alien:: modules for simple libraries.

Initially the target will be Alien::GSL (and probably other Gnu libraries) but in principle there is no limitation.

Special thanks go out to:

Christian Walde (Mithaldu) for productive conversations about component interoperablility
